# Bitcoin Retirement Basics: Getting Started with Digital Assets

If you're considering Bitcoin as part of your retirement strategy, you're not alone. More people are discovering how digital assets can complement traditional retirement planning.

## Understanding Bitcoin's Role in Retirement

Bitcoin offers several unique characteristics that make it attractive for long-term wealth preservation:

- **Limited Supply**: Only 21 million Bitcoin will ever exist
- **Decentralization**: No single entity controls the network
- **Portability**: Easy to transfer and store securely
